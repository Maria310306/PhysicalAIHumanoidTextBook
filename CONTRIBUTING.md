# Contribution Guidelines

This document outlines the process for contributing to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project.

## Spec-Driven Development Workflow

All contributions to this project must follow a strict spec-driven development approach as defined in our [constitution](.specify/memory/constitution.md):

1. **Specification Phase**: All new features must begin with a written specification
2. **Planning Phase**: Features are planned according to the execution strategy
3. **Task Generation**: Specific, testable tasks are derived from plans
4. **Implementation Phase**: Tasks are implemented according to specifications
5. **History Recording**: All changes are documented in Prompt History Records

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch from the `main` branch
3. Follow the spec → plan → task → implementation workflow
4. Document your changes with a Prompt History Record
5. Submit a pull request to the `main` branch

## Opening Issues

Use the appropriate issue template based on the type of contribution:

- **Specification Addition**: For proposing new specs
- **Planning Update**: For adjustments to the execution plan
- **Task Creation**: For creating specific executable tasks
- **Implementation Issue**: For reporting problems with existing implementations
- **Prompt History Record**: For documenting work done

## Pull Request Requirements

- Link to the related issue(s)
- Reference the relevant specification and plan sections
- Include updated Prompt History Records
- All code examples must run without modification
- Safety protocols must be demonstrated where applicable

## Code of Conduct

- Respect the simulation-first approach
- Prioritize safety in all robotics implementations
- Maintain academic rigor in all content
- Follow established technical accuracy standards

## Questions?

If you have questions about contributing to this project, please open a discussion issue and reference the relevant parts of the specification or execution plan.
