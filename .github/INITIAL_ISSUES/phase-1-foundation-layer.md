## Description
Complete Phase 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook development: Foundation Layer. This phase establishes theoretical basis for Physical AI and embodied intelligence, defines ROS 2 architecture and core concepts, and develops robot modeling fundamentals with URDF.

## Deliverables
- Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI
- Chapter 2: ROS 2 Fundamentals
- Chapter 3: Robot Modeling with URDF and Kinematics
- Foundational code examples in ROS 2

## Entry Criteria
- Development environment set up with ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill
- Project constitution and specification approved
- Team assigned with appropriate expertise

## Exit Criteria
- All three chapters completed and reviewed
- Code examples validated in ROS 2 environment
- Technical accuracy confirmed by domain expert review
- Safety protocols integrated throughout content

## Dependencies
- None (first phase)

## Validation Requirements
- Code examples must run without modification
- Concepts must be explained with physical intuition
- All content must be appropriate for undergraduate audience
- Safety considerations must be addressed in all robotics content
