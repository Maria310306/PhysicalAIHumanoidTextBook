## Description
Complete Phase 4 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook development: Control and Locomotion. This phase develops motor control algorithms, creates locomotion and balance systems, and implements manipulation and grasping strategies.

## Deliverables
- Chapter 9: Motor Control and Locomotion
- Chapter 10: Manipulation and Grasping
- Control algorithms with safety bounds
- Motion planning demonstrations

## Entry Criteria
- Phase 3 deliverables completed and approved
- Perception systems from Phase 3 operational
- Validated simulation environments with physics modeling

## Exit Criteria
- Both chapters completed and reviewed
- Control algorithms validated in simulation environments
- Locomotion and manipulation examples run successfully
- Safety bounds verified for all motor commands
- Technical accuracy confirmed by domain expert review

## Dependencies
- Phase 3: Perception Systems Development (complete before starting)

## Validation Requirements
- Motor control algorithms must include safety validation
- Locomotion systems must demonstrate stability in simulation
- Manipulation strategies must handle diverse objects appropriately
- All motor commands must include force/torque limits validation
- Safety protocols must be demonstrated in all control implementations
