## Description
Complete Phase 2 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook development: Simulation Environment Setup. This phase configures Gazebo environments for humanoid robotics, integrates Unity for advanced visualization, and sets up NVIDIA Isaac Sim pipelines.

## Deliverables
- Chapter 4: Gazebo Simulation Environments
- Chapter 5: Unity Integration
- Chapter 6: NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS
- Configured simulation environments

## Entry Criteria
- Phase 1 deliverables completed and approved
- Development environment includes Gazebo Garden, Unity 2022 LTS, Isaac Sim 2023.1
- Robot models from Phase 1 available in URDF format

## Exit Criteria
- All three chapters completed and reviewed
- Simulation environments properly configured and validated
- All examples run successfully in respective simulation environments
- Technical accuracy confirmed by domain expert review

## Dependencies
- Phase 1: Foundation Layer (complete before starting)

## Validation Requirements
- Simulation environments must be reproducible from provided parameters
- All simulation examples must run in specified tools
- Hardware setup instructions must enable successful deployment
- Safety considerations must be addressed in all simulation content
