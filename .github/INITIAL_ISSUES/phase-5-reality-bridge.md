## Description
Complete Phase 5 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook development: Reality Bridge. This phase addresses sim-to-real transfer methodologies, validates safety protocols in simulated systems, and evaluates performance against benchmarks.

## Deliverables
- Chapter 12: Sim-to-Real Transfer
- Chapter 13: Safety Protocols
- Chapter 14: Ethics in Humanoid Robotics
- Performance validation reports

## Entry Criteria
- Phase 4 deliverables completed and approved
- Control systems from Phase 4 operational
- Simulated humanoid platform demonstrates full functionality

## Exit Criteria
- All three chapters completed and reviewed
- Sim-to-real transfer methods validated and documented
- Safety protocols comprehensively covered and demonstrated
- Performance evaluated against established benchmarks
- Technical accuracy confirmed by domain expert review

## Dependencies
- Phase 4: Control and Locomotion (complete before starting)

## Validation Requirements
- Sim-to-real transfer methodologies must be clearly explained
- Safety protocols must be demonstrated in all simulated scenarios
- Ethics considerations must be integrated throughout content
- Performance benchmarks must be realistic and measurable
- Reality gap compensation methods must be validated
