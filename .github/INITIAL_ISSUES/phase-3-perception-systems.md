## Description
Complete Phase 3 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook development: Perception Systems Development. This phase implements computer vision for robotics, develops Vision-Language-Action model integration, and designs sensor fusion approaches.

## Deliverables
- Chapter 7: Perception Systems
- Chapter 8: Vision-Language-Action Models
- Chapter 11: Sensor Fusion
- Validated perception pipelines

## Entry Criteria
- Phase 2 deliverables completed and approved
- Simulation environments from Phase 2 operational
- Access to appropriate sensor simulation capabilities

## Exit Criteria
- All three chapters completed and reviewed
- Perception pipelines validated in simulation environments
- Vision-Language-Action models integrated and demonstrated
- Technical accuracy confirmed by domain expert review

## Dependencies
- Phase 2: Simulation Environment Setup (complete before starting)

## Validation Requirements
- Perception algorithms must function correctly in simulation environments
- Vision-Language-Action models must demonstrate integration with robotic systems
- Sensor fusion approaches must handle noisy data appropriately
- Safety considerations must be addressed in all perception content
