# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: From Digital Intelligence to Embodied Systems

This repository contains the specification and implementation for a university-level textbook on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. The project follows a strict spec-driven development approach governed by our [constitution](.specify/memory/constitution.md).

## Project Structure

- `.specify/memory/constitution.md` — Project principles and constraints
- `specs/<feature>/spec.md` — Feature requirements
- `specs/<feature>/plan.md` — Architecture decisions
- `specs/<feature>/tasks.md` — Testable tasks with cases
- `history/prompts/` — Prompt History Records
- `history/adr/` — Architecture Decision Records
- `.specify/` — SpecKit Plus templates and scripts

## Contributing

All contributions must follow the spec-driven workflow:
1. Create/update specifications
2. Create/update plans
3. Generate tasks from plans
4. Implement according to tasks
5. Document changes in Prompt History Records
