# Prompt History Record: Create Physical AI Constitution

## Prompt Text
Act as a Principal Systems Architect and Technical Editor.

/sp.constitution

This file is the GLOBAL RULE BOOK for a spec-driven project whose final output is a university-level book:
"Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics (Embodied Intelligence)"

Domain:
• Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics
• ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity
• NVIDIA Isaac Sim / Isaac ROS
• Vision-Language-Action (LLMs + Robotics)
• Sim-to-Real systems

Purpose of this file:
• Define non-negotiable rules for writing, specs, tasks, and implementations
• Govern all future specs created with Spec Kit Plus
• Prevent hallucinated robotics APIs or unsafe robot behavior
• Enforce spec → plan → task → implementation workflow
• Define rules for sub-agents and reusable intelligence
• Set documentation standards for Docusaurus (Markdown-first)

Mandatory sections (keep concise but strict):
1. Purpose & Authority
2. Core Principles of Physical AI
3. Spec-Driven Development Rules
4. Sub-Agent & Reusable Intelligence Rules
5. Technical Accuracy & Safety Rules
6. Simulation vs Real-World Boundaries
7. Documentation Standards (Docusaurus)
8. AI Behavior Constraints
9. Prohibited Actions
10. Amendment Policy

Style rules:
• Output ONLY the contents of /sp.constitution
• Markdown only
• Clear, strict, professional tone
• No emojis, no fluff, no marketing
• No references to "as an AI model"

This constitution must feel enforceable in a real robotics lab.
