## Recommended Preparation
Before starting this module, we recommend students complete the following preparation activities:

1. Install NVIDIA Isaac Sim and familiarize yourself with the interface
2. Set up the Isaac ROS development environment
3. Complete basic tutorials for NVIDIA Isaac platform
4. Review fundamentals of deep learning and computer vision
5. Set up a development environment with appropriate GPU support

While prior experience with NVIDIA Isaac is helpful, the module includes foundational concepts for those new to the platform. However, students without robotics AI experience may need additional time to become proficient with the tools and concepts.
