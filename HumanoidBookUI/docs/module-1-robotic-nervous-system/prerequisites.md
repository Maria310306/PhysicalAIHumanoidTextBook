# Prerequisites: Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Students should possess the following knowledge and skills before beginning this module:

## Programming Fundamentals
- Proficiency in C++ and Python programming languages
- Understanding of object-oriented programming concepts
- Experience with multithreading and asynchronous programming
- Familiarity with version control systems (Git)

## Mathematics and Algorithms
- Linear algebra fundamentals (vectors, matrices, transformations)
- Basic calculus concepts for motion control
- Understanding of control theory basics (PID controllers)
- Knowledge of computer science algorithms and data structures

## Robotics Concepts
- Basic understanding of kinematics (forward and inverse kinematics)
- Familiarity with sensors commonly used in robotics (cameras, IMUs, encoders)
- Understanding of actuator types and their control
- Basic knowledge of robot dynamics and control

## System Administration
- Linux command-line proficiency (Ubuntu preferred)
- Ability to install packages and configure system settings
- Experience with development environments and IDEs
- Understanding of networking concepts (TCP/IP, UDP)

## Software Development Skills
- Experience with building systems (CMake, colcon, pip)
- Understanding of debugging techniques for distributed systems
- Familiarity with simulation tools (Gazebo, RViz, V-REP)
- Basic knowledge of Docker containers and package management

## Recommended Preparation
Before starting this module, we recommend students complete the following preparation activities:

1. Install ROS 2 (latest stable distribution) on a Linux system (preferably Ubuntu 22.04 LTS)
2. Complete the official ROS 2 tutorials (turtlesim, publisher/subscriber examples)
3. Review the basics of distributed computing concepts
4. Familiarize yourself with the specific humanoid robot platform that will be used in later modules (e.g., NAO, Pepper, or custom designs)
5. Set up a development environment with appropriate IDEs and debugging tools

While prior ROS experience is beneficial, it is not strictly required as this module includes foundational concepts. However, students without ROS experience may need to spend additional time on preparatory material to achieve proficiency at the expected level.
