# Prerequisites: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Students should possess the following knowledge and skills before beginning this module:

## Programming Fundamentals
- Proficiency in C++ and Python programming languages
- Understanding of object-oriented programming concepts
- Experience with multithreading and asynchronous programming
- Familiarity with version control systems (Git)

## Mathematics and Algorithms
- Linear algebra fundamentals (vectors, matrices, transformations)
- Understanding of kinematics (forward and inverse kinematics)
- Basic understanding of dynamics and physics simulation
- Knowledge of computer graphics concepts (3D transformations, rendering)

## Robotics Concepts
- Basic understanding of robot kinematics and dynamics
- Familiarity with sensors commonly used in robotics (cameras, IMUs, lidars)
- Understanding of actuator dynamics and control
- Knowledge of robot operating systems (especially ROS/ROS 2)

## Simulation Experience
- Basic experience with any physics simulation software (optional but helpful)
- Understanding of 3D modeling concepts and file formats (STL, URDF, FBX)
- Knowledge of coordinate systems and transformations in 3D space
- Familiarity with visualization tools (RViz, Gazebo GUI)

## System Administration
- Linux command-line proficiency (Ubuntu preferred)
- Ability to install and configure simulation software
- Experience with development environments and IDEs
- Understanding of GPU acceleration and rendering concepts

## Software Development Skills
- Experience with building and configuring simulation frameworks
- Understanding of debugging techniques for simulation environments
- Familiarity with performance profiling tools
- Basic knowledge of Docker containers for simulation environments

## Recommended Preparation
Before starting this module, we recommend students complete the following preparation activities:

1. Install Gazebo (Harmonic or newer) and Unity (2022.3 LTS or newer)
2. Complete basic tutorials for both platforms
3. Review ROS/ROS 2 integration with simulation environments
4. Familiarize yourself with URDF format and robot modeling concepts
5. Set up a development environment with appropriate GPU support for rendering

While prior simulation experience is beneficial, the module includes foundational concepts for those new to digital twin development. However, students without robotics simulation experience may need additional time to become proficient with the tools.
