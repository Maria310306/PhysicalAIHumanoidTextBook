- Knowledge of neural network architectures and training

## AI and Machine Learning
- Understanding of computer vision fundamentals (CNNs, object detection)
- Knowledge of natural language processing concepts (transformers, attention)
- Experience with multimodal learning approaches
- Basics of reinforcement learning

## Robotics Concepts
- Basic understanding of robot kinematics and control
- Familiarity with ROS/ROS 2 for robot communication
- Knowledge of sensors commonly used in robotics (cameras, joint encoders)
- Understanding of robot manipulation and navigation

## Vision-Language Systems
- Basic understanding of vision-language models (CLIP, BLIP, etc.)
- Knowledge of multimodal representation learning
- Experience with large language models
- Understanding of grounding concepts in AI

## System Administration
- Linux command-line proficiency (Ubuntu preferred)
- Experience with GPU-accelerated computing (CUDA)
- Ability to install and configure deep learning frameworks
- Understanding of containerization (Docker) for AI applications

## Software Development Skills
- Experience with building and deploying AI models
- Understanding of debugging techniques for complex AI systems

## Recommended Preparation
Before starting this module, we recommend students complete the following preparation activities:

1. Review fundamentals of computer vision and natural language processing
2. Complete tutorials on multimodal learning frameworks
3. Familiarize yourself with pre-trained vision-language models
4. Set up a development environment with appropriate GPU support
5. Review basic robotics concepts if needed

While prior experience with vision-language models is helpful, the module includes foundational concepts for those new to the field. However, students without AI and robotics experience may need additional time to become proficient with the tools and concepts.
